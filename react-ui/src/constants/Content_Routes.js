SKILLS:


HTML
Turning Leanring into Knowledge and knowledge into Skills
blenidng project based learning and old school regurgiate memoriaze 
Using techincal langauge like CEo codesmith taught


Dev Skill: Be able to use version control to develop 
maintain code already written make imporvements fix bugs 
the main thing needed is a reference guide so how can that best be done

kinda like a checklist to back up the project based learning 
Project :  What you will need to know to do this project
When you are done what you should be able to know 

road map like that react guy made


quizzes checkpoints
objectives from the class lesson plan 
vocab throughout 

Project: 

Time is a huge issue:  what to study out side of class

asking the right questions like that guide

the get the student to arrive at that moment-- 
USING IT but also understanding it
