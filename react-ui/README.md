This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

If KARD mastering score is less than 4/5 or 80 overall tehn RESET and start over the item

SO in master list its just a reference of where to go and bypass all this fancy stuff

Dashbaord
has 1 graph of overal mastery scores
overall tasks done and left

explanations and settings to turn off and on remnders stuff or something
and maybe links to email teacher or corrine who knows.

DEMO examples of KARD and pop up modal of what an exmaple screen or notes section or sand box or soemthing

ADMIN tab - sees scores of each student for each task - Maybe add and delete links and see list of all links and likes and dislikes

maybe add flash cards but not sure
turn comments into flash cards then make BUTTON at top for them

reminder snack bar - for task completed and on click someting REMEMBER to write quality CELAN code.

maybe a dashboard options for SKILLS and go to skills screen how to think liek programmer algorithms number of projects who knows

progress stepper
watch in any bootcamp youtube walk through and class activity review .

DASHBAORD - WHY THIS TOOL ? why another tool

Learning strategies next to skills
STUCK READ ME stuff
https://medium.freecodecamp.org/learning-how-to-learn-the-most-important-developer-skill-7bf62dfaf67d
ALSO see her link to Closures
WHY?
How is this different from other solutions?
How useful is this to me?
What problems does this solution aim to solve?
Is this just a new shiny tool that’ll only be useful for a few months or will it fundamentally change the way I think and code?
What is the motivation for learning this?
First step: I’d start with a Google search for the React.js documentation and read a bit about the background and motivation for the library.

any intro articles or examples provided in the docs.
Reading and sinking in the core concepts comes before hands-on experimentation. It’s incredibly important to do this because it lays the foundation for the rest of my learning.

For example, if there’s an online CRUD todos example (of course) using React.js, maybe I’ll build a different type of CRUD application. Just different enough to keep me engaged, but not so different as to make me discouraged if something goes wrong.

she just validated my entire process

Mastery
Mastery requires repetition, so I keep building more small projects until I feel like I’ve got the core concepts down.

HW - what is needed - 1
Checkpoint answers - 2
Activities and Teacher material like slides what concepts are covered -3
Correlate all 3 of that and then my own opinion of what is needed. 4. My Full stack mastery sheet

Check my other notes from last couple days too
Makes simple site search on resources page with tags. Like blog.

Coders bay and friend finder somehow put into hogwarts. Bid on projects like guru. Match up for groups
Planner to do list on dashboard like projects to study and stuff
Colander for office hours and or tutor organizer

About me. New portfolio page.

It’s almost impossible to keep everything current. So googling the latest.
Best practices. -  
Meet ups asking

Top recommded courses. What to do after the bootcamp - top got hub repos to follow.

Reminders with interview questions. Cs Vocab.

The main things is About page. You cannot just memorize for the test you have to be able to recall and use it. When and if called upon -

CEO cod smith. JavaScript hard parts.
Watching tutorials how to master ?????
Google stack overflow copy paste. Actually use the meme O RIELY. Books I guess
Combine memorize and application. My p blessing.

What would IOT you want finding your coding passion.  
Taking best of free code camp and code cademy. But rate yourself. Not just pass a test. Pluarlaisght tests. And possible add in.

Final capstone feature of all my thoughts. Jobs board and stat counter. Income - top income. Median. Glassdoor style. How many interviews. Etc.

Student organizer. - components. Snippets. Reusable repository. Got hub. Organize your stuff. Like a react admin UI kit. But your own. Building a UI kit. NPM module and open sourcing Top level of ceo code smith levels of skills programming

RANDOM NOTES from apple notes log
App for learning.
My learning language.

Have to do a sandbox at minimum 48 hours after for maximum recall test.

Challenges : 10 things common in web dev. The course already has them.
Likes , comments.
Coders bay.
Friend finder or something
Linked in
Twotter
Build 2 Wordpress square space or bootstrap these sites for a friend or friend of friend. Or volunteer work.
Links to open source triage stuff
Clone 2 favorite websites that are not in those tops 10. No looking at chrome tools best you can. Lost of tools to use to scrape and so forth. Font color picker.

CS. Stuff.
Types of resource QA. React native people congomelrage. Examples of are good place to think outside th box and see what you can do.
What. Explain like I don’t know. Key as much as you can without overdoing it but being extremely explicit and with flowery technical languages

Why ? Important what context ? Or contrast. Benefit .. When or w

How. Explain conceptually. Give an example. And code a real love example with no help or errors.

Equals mastered

Lead minds to the answer - step by little step. Like telephone repeat each step go back to the beginning
UOFU Objectives sheet - Make a running list of all concepts used in class for a classic checklist type approach to learning - Then ideas on how to use it all - extra activites modeled after class activities

1.  Watch all class videos
2.  Watch all HW walkthough vidoes
3.  Do sandbox DRILLS
    make some drills and extra activites
4.  BUILD
5.  Know all this stuff and be able to explain it out loud to someone

PURPOSE have a slightly more sturcutred organiztion for all the concepts to check off
KNOW all this and ace the HW mainly its a list of everything in all the class activites on one sheet to have a master checkoff sheet.

free apis to hit - swapi etc.

job skill
take from HW activites too

Think like a compiler
understadning how compters work

DEv ops
my fullstack mastery apply book

Resources
BOiler plate AUTH and starters

w3Schools and MDN for HTML CSS Javascript
warning and benefits

recommended companion courses
see book files

Score -
0-100
80/20 coding rule

Frustrating cuase W3Schools has those huge lists under TUTORIALS
and that is like the perfect list
W#schools quizes
and that one site used at dev mtn
5-6 that might be useful

https://www.w3schools.com/quiztest/quiztest.asp?qtest=PHP
Explanation of site and how it can should be used

officical ECMA script links
ALONG with my 4 combined efforts
repo activities and all that
copy from best tutorials - like the CATEGORY content lists
and so forth

It gets so big how to orient the user ? guide them little by little

CSS style framworks element ui awesome list for front end dev

submit feedback on dashbporad helpnbugs etc
